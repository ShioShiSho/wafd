# We all fall down - a Minecraft minigame

We all fall down (a.k.a. wafd, and yes it is pronounced waff'd) is a Minecraft minigame based around the battle royale gamemode - where the focus is on strong parkour movement skills and on getting environmental kills.

After downloading the datapack, drag  the *weallfalldown* folder above the *data* folder into \<world folder>/datapacks. The final file structure should be:

```<world_folder>/datapacks/weallfalldown/data/...```
